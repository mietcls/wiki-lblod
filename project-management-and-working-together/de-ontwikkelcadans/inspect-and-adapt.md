# Inspect and Adapt

Currently, the Inspect and Adapt workshop is a new element in the scaled agile method of building and delivering products at Digiteam ABB. Therefore it is not applied to the fullest extend it is being described by[ the Scaled Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/inspect-and-adapt/). 

According to the Scaled Agile Framework, the Inspect and Adapt event typically consists of 3 parts:\
1\. PI System Demo \
2\. Quantitative and qualitative measurement\
3\. Retrospective and problem-solving workshop

Currently at Digiteam the Inspect and Adapt - where organized - focusses on a retrospective and problem solving/ inventory workshop with the product team to determine what needs to be further taken up in an upcoming Groeispurt.
