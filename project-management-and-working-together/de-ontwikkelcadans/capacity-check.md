# Capaciteit check

The capacity check(s) performed during the IPI are a moment to gather information on the availability of team members during the upcoming Groeispurt. The check is necessary to prevent team members being "overplannend" in one or more product teams leading to frustration and ultimately sprint targets not being reached. A capacity check with the developers, designers and analysts is followed by a capacity check with Product Managers and Product Owners on the day before the CPD. The outcome of the check is a view on the available mandays per team member per sprint. This info is then used to plan work during the planning session of the CPD.
