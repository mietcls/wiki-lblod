# Innovation

One of the pillars of the SAFe Lean-Agile Mindset is innovation, but finding time for ideation and change in the midst of delivery deadlines can be difficult. To this end, many enterprises use IP iterations for research and design activities such as hackathons. There are two simple rules for hackathons: People can work on whatever they want, with whomever they want, so long as the work reflects the mission of the company The teams demo their work to others at the end of the hackathon The learnings from hackathons routinely make their way into Program Backlogs and often help drive innovation.
