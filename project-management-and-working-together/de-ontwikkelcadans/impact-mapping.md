# Impact mapping

The technique of Impact mapping helps the producteams at Digiteam ABB and their stakeholders not only to visualise the product roadmaps but also to explain how deliverables connect to user needs, and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher level solutions and value streams.

For our impact mappings we use a technique of impact maps, described by [Neuri Consulting LLP](https://www.impactmapping.org). In making and updating the impact maps of a product the teams think about behaviour changes that would have a big impact on the users of the product. Next, we write them down in the impact map and group the impacts by actors, personas or user categories using branches. Next, per branch (impact per group) we add deliverables that could support those behaviour changes and target dates we aim for to realize the impact. Subsequently we include the organizational goals supported by those impacts in the mindmap.
