# Story Mapping

A user story map helps you arrange user stories into a useful model for understanding the functionality of a system, identifying holes and omissions in your backlog, and effectively plan  releases that deliver the best possible value to users and business at the time through releases.

User Story Map is becoming a popular user story management technique through the efforts of [**Jeff Patton**](http://jpattonassociates.com/blog/) and others. The user story tool allows you to establish multiple levels and dimensions for a product backlog through the breakdown of user needs as user activities, user tasks, epics and user stories. Typically, an agile development team makes use of story map in collaborative meetings in identifying the desired results the end users want to achieve.
