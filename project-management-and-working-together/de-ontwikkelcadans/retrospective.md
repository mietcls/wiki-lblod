# Retrospective

The sprint retrospective is a recurring meeting held at the end of a Groeispurt and is used to discuss what went well during the previous Groeispurt cycle and what can be improved in the next Groeispurt. The Agile sprint retrospective is an essential part of the Agile Scrum way of working. At Digiteam ABB we agreed to do a retrospective at the end of four sprints and not at the end of every sprint. Issues that arise during the sprint and that have a (severe) impact on the collaboration of the product teams or on their efficiency are of course dealt with immediately by the team and the scrum master(s) and do not wait until the retrospective at the end of the Groeispurt. Consequently and ad hoc retrospective is possible.

## Steps in a retrospective

Step 1: Set the Stage. A retrospective session is most effective when everyone on the team is honest about what went well, and also what didn't. Make clear what the retrospective is about.

Step 2: Warm-up. Use a small exercise to make sure everyone say's at least one thing to warm up.  e.g.

* Tell what you had for breakfast
* Tell what your favourite  holiday destination is
* Describe the last iteration in 3 words only

Step 2: Gather Data via a template. There are many retrospective templates available on the web. Choose one to structure the collection of data. e.g.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled - Copy of Sailboat Retrospective.jpg>)

Each idea is one post-it.\
Most templates can be used in person and virtual via Miro or other online tools.

Step 3: Generating Insights with the whole group is the next stept. Start with identifying patterns and duplicates, converse about what comes up and what may help to enhance or remediate it.

Step 4: Decide What To Do by creating a short list of things to keep in mind during their next sprint.

Step 5: Tying A Bow On The Retrospective by letting everyone reflect on the session.
